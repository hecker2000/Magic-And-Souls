When using the Magic Smith, it takes two input items and spits out an item in return.

To craft all basic scrolls, recipes are as follows:

- 1 scroll + flint and steal, gives the Fire scroll.
- 1 scroll + ice block, gives the Ice scroll.
- 1 scroll + darkness item, gives the Darkness scroll.
- 1 scroll + totem of undying, gives the Evocation scroll.
