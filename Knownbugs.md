# We know of a few bugs already, so here's a few we found

## Scrolls with special logic don't use essence when used (execpt for basic evoker scroll):
- Darkness scroll
- Fire shower scroll

## Jei menu has two outlines
- Yeah i have no idea how to fix that

## Darkness scroll does not make sound when used

## Summoned soul item only does animation when other summoned soul items are in hand
- this also means that a stack limit was not imposed
